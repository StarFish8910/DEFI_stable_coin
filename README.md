# DEFI_stable_coin

A decentralized finance (DeFi) project implementing a stablecoin using Solidity smart contracts.

## Overview

**DEFI_stable_coin** is a smart contract-based system for issuing and managing a decentralized stablecoin. The project is designed for transparency, security, and interoperability within the Ethereum ecosystem. Core logic is written in Solidity, ensuring compatibility with Ethereum-based wallets and dApps.

## Features

- **Stablecoin Issuance:** Mint and burn stablecoins pegged to a reference asset (such as USD).
- **Collateralization:** Supports collateral deposits to back minted stablecoins.
- **Decentralized Governance:** Allow stakeholders to participate in the protocol's decision-making (if implemented).
- **Transparency:** All transactions and balances are verifiable on-chain.
- **Security:** Utilizes best practices for smart contract security.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) (for development and testing)
- [Solidity compiler](https://soliditylang.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/StarFish8910/DEFI_stable_coin.git
    cd DEFI_stable_coin
    ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Compilation

Compile the smart contracts using your preferred Solidity development framework:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
# or
truffle compile
```

### Deployment

Configure your deployment settings (network, private key, etc.) in your framework of choice and deploy:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>
# or
truffle migrate --network <network>
```

### Testing

Run contract tests to ensure everything works as intended:

```bash
npx hardhat test
# or
truffle test
```

## Project Structure

- `contracts/` — Solidity smart contracts for stablecoin issuance, collateral management, and protocol logic.
- `test/` — Automated tests for smart contract functionality.
- `scripts/` — Deployment and utility scripts.
- `Makefile` — Automation for common tasks (compilation, deployment, etc.).

## Security

Security is a top priority. Please review the code and audit before deploying to mainnet. Pull requests or issues regarding vulnerabilities are welcome.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you'd like to help improve the project.
